# Excel – Amazon 2025 Consumer Trends in Miami & PayPal Dominance	
**TL;DR:** Miami leads in consumer payments; PayPal dominates	

## Problem
Retail teams need to understand which cities contribute the most to sales and which payment channels customers prefer to optimize marketing spend, product allocation, and checkout experience.

## Data
- Source: Kaggle — Amazon Sales 2025 (by Zahid Mughal)

## Business Understanding
1. Which city has the biggest contribution on sales?
2. Which payment method has the highest total transaction value?

## Data Understanding 
1. Imported raw CSV
2. Applied text to column
3. Converted dataset to excel table
4. Data Checking (datatype and missing value)

## Data Preparation
1. Remove Duplicates
2. Standardized data types (dates → Date, prices → Currency)
3. Merging Queries
4. Created calculated columns as needed
5. Loaded cleaned table back to Excel

## Modelling
1. Power Query (ETL Modelling), merge columns/tables to build a clean final table, standardized column names and formats
2. No Power Pivot relationships needed due to single-table model

## Analysis
1. Pivot Table
2. Pivot Chart
3. Slicers for dynamic filtering (city, product, payment method)

## Visualization
1. Created KPI cards (Total Sales, AOV, Orders)
2. Built a single-page dashboard with charts and slicers
