# Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi, I’m Rama — a UX-minded Data Analyst passionate about turning raw data into clear stories that inform better design and business decisions.

My background in UX design gives me a unique perspective in understanding human behavior through data. I’m focused on building insights that are not only statistically sound, but also meaningful and actionable for real users.

This portfolio showcases projects that combine **data analysis**, and **storytelling** using tools such as **Excel**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**.
