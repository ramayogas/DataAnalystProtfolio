### 🧪 Data Analyst Portfolio
Hi, I’m Yogas — a UX-minded Data Analyst passionate about turning raw data into clear stories to uncover patterns that explain user behavior and improve decision-making.

My background in UX design gives me a unique perspective in understanding human behavior through data. I’m focused on building insights that are not only statistically sound, but also meaningful and actionable for real users.

This portfolio showcases projects that combine **data analysis**, and **storytelling** using tools such as **Excel**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **Looker Studio**
